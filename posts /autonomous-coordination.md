# The Integration Bottleneck

For decades, B2B synchronization has relied on brittle APIs and manual oversight. As we move into 2026, the volume of data requires a layer that doesn't just "connect" but "coordinates."

## Why Neutral Sync Matters
Our latest research into **Neural Sync v2** suggests that latency can be reduced by 40% when the protocol predicts handshake patterns before they occur.

* **Low Latency:** Sub-60ms synchronization.
* **Security:** SOC2 compliant by design.
* **Scale:** Handling 1.2M requests per month.

> "The goal isn't just to move data, it's to automate the trust between two disparate systems."

Stay tuned as we roll out Phase II of our Beta Access.
