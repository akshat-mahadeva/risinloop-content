# High-Frequency Coordination

In smart calendar management, speed is synonymous with reliability. If an agent takes 30 seconds to "think" about a conflict, the user has already moved on. Our engineering focus has been on reducing the **Inference-to-Action (I2A)** gap.

### The ReAct Framework

By utilizing a **ReAct (Reason + Act)** loop, our agent can observe a scheduling conflict, reason about the priority of the two events, and act to resolve the overlap in under 15ms.

- **Temporal Parsing:** Instant normalization of timezones (ISO 8601).
- **Edge Inference:** Moving the logic layer closer to the user’s physical location.
- **Atomic Execution:** Ensuring that a calendar update is either 100% complete or rolled back, preventing "ghost meetings."
