# Beyond the Webform

Static lead qualification is dead. In a world of instant information, waiting for a human SDR to "vet" a lead results in a 40% drop-off rate. Our research focuses on **Autonomous Qualification Agents (AQA)** that interact in real-time.

### Multi-Modal Intent Recognition

Our agent doesn't just read text; it analyzes intent. By processing social signals, company firmographics, and conversation sentiment, the agent builds a dynamic "Propensity to Buy" score.

- **Data Parsing:** Extraction of key pain points from initial queries.
- **Contextual Awareness:** Referencing internal CRM data without human prompts.
- **Automated Handshake:** Passing the "warm" lead directly into a confirmed calendar slot.
