# The Future of Coordination

Traditional synchronization methods are no longer sufficient for the scale of 2026. **Neural Sync v2** introduces a predictive coordination layer that anticipates data requirements before they are requested.

## Technical Specifications

- **Protocol:** Neural-UDP
- **Latency Target:** < 15ms
- **Throughput:** 10GB/s

> "Automation isn't just about speed; it's about the intelligence of the connection."

### What's Next?

We are opening the first round of beta testing for the coordination layer. If you are an enterprise partner, check your dashboard for the new API keys.
