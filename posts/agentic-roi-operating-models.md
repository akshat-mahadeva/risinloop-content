# The ROI of Autonomy

What is the cost of a missed meeting? In enterprise B2B, a single missed discovery call can represent a $50k+ loss in pipeline value. Autonomous agents solve this "leaky bucket" problem.

### Near-Zero Marginal Cost

Unlike traditional SDR teams, an agentic workforce scales horizontally. Whether you have 10 leads or 10,000, the marginal cost of qualification and scheduling remains near zero.

### Human-AI Handoff Points

The key to a successful implementation is the **Handoff Logic**. Our system identifies high-value opportunities and creates a "seamless friction" point where a human takes over exactly when the relationship-building phase begins.
